# WebGL (ThreeJS) : Bat Signal
![Screenshot](/screenshot/batsignal.PNG)

Thanks to webGL, we create :
- a rotating bat shape 
- a SpotLight
- two light spheres moving around the bat shape
- a plane to check the shadows
- controls to have fun with the bat shape
- zoom in or out with the mouse scroll
